## Tech Stack

### Zephyr 3B

I modified the default to run the [Zephyr 3B model](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-zephyr-3b) for extracting concepts out of text chunks. It can follow the system prompt instructions very well. 

### Ollama
<a href="https://ollama.ai"><img src='https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/assets/3325447/0d0b44e2-8f4a-4e99-9b52-a5c1c741c8f7 ' height='50'/></a>

Ollama makes it easy to host any model locally.

To set up this project, you must install Ollama on your local machine. 

Step 1: Install Ollama https://ollama.ai

Step 2: run `ollama run zephyr` in your terminal. This will pull the zephyr model to your local machine and start the Ollama server.

### Pandas 
dataframes for graph schema (can use a graphdb at a later stage).

### NetworkX 
<a href="https://networkx.org"><img src="https://networkx.org/_static/networkx_logo.svg" height=50 /><a/>

This is a python library that makes dealing with graphs super easy

### Pyvis
[Pyvis python library](https://github.com/WestHealth/pyvis/tree/master) for visualisation. Pyvis generates Javascript Graph visualisations using python, so the final graphs can be hosted on the web. For example the [github link of this repo](https://rahulnyk.github.io/knowledge_graph/) is a graph generated by pyvis
